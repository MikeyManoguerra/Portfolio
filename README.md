Portfolio 1.0 Mikey Manoguerra

My public portfolio. The node tree is assembled with javascript, and the elements are generated with content in a data file.

This has been a good exercise in how the DOM works and the basics of Javascript. Some more styling is in order, as well as a little more flexibility in the utility functions. 

Please see this as a contrived example of a web page, and not a sustainable or scaleable project in its current iteration.
