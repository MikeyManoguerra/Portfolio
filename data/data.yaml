#   about1: I have an eye for detail and care about writing clean, modular, and well commented code.
#             Find me writing JavaScript using React, Redux, Node.js, Mongoose, Knex, and jQuery.
#             Some other technologies I use are Python, Django, PostGresQL, MongoDB, Git version control, CICD, as well
#             as Enzyme, Mocha, and Chai.
#   about2: I have a passion for learning new things and tackling problems with ease. I have
#             lots of daily experience with collaboration, pair programming, and understand the benefits of teamwork. You'll
#             be amazed at what I can do, and how fast I can learn!
#   recently: Since January, I have been an integral member of a Code For Philly project for Prevention Point,
#             Philadelphia. We are building a Django/React Reporting and Appointment Application. The work I have done has
#             been primarily server side.

#             I spent the month of July 2019 teaching two classes of Javascript every day for the SMASH Academy at the
#             Wharton School of Business.
#             This intensive high school age national STEM program has the goal of inspiring and preparing under represented
#             communities for STEM careers.
#             My class covered the fundamentals of JavaScript, using the p5.JS library.

#     - title: Views-Via-ISS
#       description: This app uses coding best practices for front end functionality and session persistence of data. The app uses three different API's, One to get the current location of the International Space Station, A second to get LandSat 8 image data of the location, and a third to get a matching static map. The LandSat 8 API returns 500 errors if no image exists per the request, and since most of the earth is water by surface area, this is a lot of errors. Views via Iss handles errors, stores successful responses, and allows changing the parameters of the location. The next step is to allow to search through your session's successful requests. Another addition would be to find another live-location data source with a circum-polar orbit.

#       description: This project uses a spaced repetition algorithm to serve a list of foreign words in an order based upon how often you get the word correct. More successful answers mean more time before the word appears again. This is version 2.0 of the app, which is refactored from a pair project. The user can now pick from several languages, and the database will hold the history of the user for each. The code base is in a mono repo.
